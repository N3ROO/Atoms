Five balls (atoms) are secretly placed on a checkerboard of 8 Ã— 8 boxes. We do not see these balls on the board, the goal of the player is to find out where these balls are in as few shots as possible.

Made for the Web programming (client side) course at the Bordeaux Institude of Technology (grade: 19/20).
